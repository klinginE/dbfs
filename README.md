## Reinstall instructions ##
If you have used this application before and it is already installed on your
iPad or iPad simulator then you may need to reinstall before using this
software. If this is your first time using the software you do not need to do
this step. We found that performing the following steps guarantees a fresh
start.

Warning, that this will erase any data you may have previously stored on
the mobileDrive app. To avoid loss of data download all data off the
mobileDrive app, that you don't want deleted, before performing a reinstall.

To Reinstall:
1) Open mobileDrive/mobileDrive.xcodeproj using XCode and click the play button.
2) After it has started up completely press the stop button.
3) On the iPad or iPad simulator press and hold down the mobileDirve app. All
   your apps should start shaking.
4) Push the x on the left hand corner of the mobileDrive app.
5) Confirm the deletion of the app.
6) Press the home button on the iPad or if you are using the simulator go to
   the Hardware menu and click on the "Home" option.
7) In Xcode do a clean by going under the product menu and clicking on "Clean"
8) Clear all web browser history.

## Testing the iPad Interface ##
Open the mobileDrive/mobileDrive.xcodeproj using XCode click play button.
Click on "Need Help?" in the right hand corner if you need help.

## Testing the Web Interface ##
Once the iPad application is up and running you can get to the web
interface by typing in the IP address, located at the bottom of the iPad
window, into your favorite web browser address bar.

Double click the desired directory to navigate to it. Files can be sorted by
clicking on the respective header (name, type, etc).

When Uploading a file to the iPad the the bar on the right should show the
status of the upload. After the bar has fully loaded it may pause for a while
on the last bit. During this time it is writing the file to the iPad. Wait until
the status bar reads "Done!". It is at this point that the file has finished
uploading.
